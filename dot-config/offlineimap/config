# Offlineimap sample configuration file

# This file documents *all* possible options and can be quite scary.
# Looking for a quick start?  Take a look at offlineimap.conf.minimal.
# More details can be found at http://www.offlineimap.org .

# General definitions
##################################################

# NOTE 1: Settings generally support python interpolation. This means
# values can contain python format strings which refer to other values
# in the same section, or values in a special DEFAULT section. This
# allows you for example to use common settings for multiple accounts:
#
# [Repository Gmail1]
# trashfolder: %(gmailtrashfolder)s
#
# [Repository Gmail2]
# trashfolder: %(gmailtrashfolder)s
#
# [DEFAULT]
# gmailtrashfolder = [Gmail]/Papierkorb
#
# would set the trashfolder setting for your German Gmail accounts.

# NOTE 2: Above feature implies that any '%' needs to be encoded as '%%'

# NOTE 3: Any variable that is subject to the environment variables
# ($NAME) and tilde (~username/~) expansions will receive tilde
# expansion first and only after the environment variable will be
# expanded in the resulting string. This behaviour is intentional
# as it coincides with typical shell expansion strategy.

# NOTE 4: multiple same-named sections.
# The library used to parse the configuration file has known issue when multiple
# sections have the same name. In such case, only the last section is considered.
# It is strongly discouraged to have multiple sections with the same name.
# See https://github.com/OfflineIMAP/offlineimap/issues/143 for more details.
